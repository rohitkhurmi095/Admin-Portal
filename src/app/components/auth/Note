Note:
-> As per Angular, when you manually refresh the page, the entire application state is reset, including the authentication status. 
-> However, when navigating between tabs within the application, the application state might not be fully reset, causing the user to stay logged in.
-> To maintain application state (including Behaviour Subjects - isLoggedIn,currentUser) i.e keep user loggedIn when page is refreshed -> check if userDetails are already present in the localStorage 
                            -> if yes -> add details to BehaviourSubject again
                            -> else -> user will be redirected to login page (as per the authGuard)
