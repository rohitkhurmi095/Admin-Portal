//open subMenu based on active class (Parent/Child Items)
//if active class is applied on parentItem -> apply 'menu-open' class on childItem
Logic:
Ul
    li - 'active' applied based on parentItem is active (PARENT)
        a - menu (click)="OpenSubMenu(menuItem)"
        a - link
        ul - 'menu-open' applied based on ParentItem is active (CHILD)
            li - active applied based on childItem is active
                a - menu 
                a - link

//add or remove active class based on click
OpenMenuItem(item:any){
    item.active = !item.active;
}
